<h2 style="text-align:center">The story</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
<p>They said,</p> 
    <q class="ppl">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
<p>The farmer said,</p> <q class="farm"> <em>Maybe</em>.</q>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> <q class="ppl">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses! </q>
<p>The farmer again said,</p> <q class="farm"><em>Maybe</em>. </q>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
<p>The neighbors then said,</p> <q class="ppl">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span></q> 
<p>and the farmer responded,</p> <q class="farm"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
<p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
<p>Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> <q class="ppl">Isn’t that great!</q> <p>Again, he said,</p> <q class="farm"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> <br> <br>

<blockquote><q class="good">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good </span>fortune.</q></blockquote>

<h2>Conclussion</h2>  
<p class="good"><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana" target="_blank" title="Bananas">Bananas</a> are <span class="good">Good</span> for monkeys, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey" target="_blank" title="monkeys"> Monkeys</a> are not <span class="good">Good</span> for bananas.</p>
<p>Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
