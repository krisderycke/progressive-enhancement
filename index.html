<h2 style="text-align:center">The story</h2>
<hr width="50%">

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
<p>They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
<p>The farmer said, <q> <em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses! </q></p>
<p>The farmer again said, <q><em>Maybe</em>. </q></p> 
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
<p>The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad</q> and the farmer responded, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
<p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
<p>Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p> <br>

<blockquote><q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</q></blockquote>

<h2>Conclussion</h2>  
<p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas [1] are good for monkeys, but monkeys [2] are not good for bananas.</p>
<p>Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
